# ecohub

_This was all made during EarthxHack 2020._

***ecohub** is an application where you and your friends can get **volunteer hours**
for doing various tasks around your area. This is the time where you can shine your
resume and pride while helping the environment.

All it takes is a simple picture and a hunt for volunteering requests with your friends.

## How It Works

1. Register as a user.

A simple user can use those 5 steps to gain volunteering hours alone or with their
friends.

A separate account is given to organizers which allows for the creation of events
and accepting the volunteer works of different users.

## Technologies Utilized

 * Flutter
 * Google Firebase
 * Android Studio

### Flutter
We utilized a [Flutter] (https://flutter.dev/) frontend that uses the Dart programming language developed by
Google to create multiplatform apps. We chose Flutter over React Native because we believed
Dart was closer to Java which fit best with our personal experiences. Also, Flutter seems to be
more flexible in terms of UI.

### Firebase
We also used [Google Firebase] (https://firebase.google.com/) as a database as it provided a free
trial with sufficent storage. Also, due to prior bad experiences with Amazon AWS, we decided to turn
to Firebase. Also it provided quick authentication and usable API with Flutter.

### Android Studio
Finally, Android Studio was used for developing the application and testing by the developers. We
were able to use the Android virtual devices to test the application.

## Usable Platforms

The mobile app runs on both Android and iOS.
